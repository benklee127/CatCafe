# SCOPE GUARDRAILS

## Rules
1. No milestone close with known P1 gameplay breakage.
2. New ideas are parked in `Docs/IDEA_PARKING_LOT.md`.
3. No new features until current exit criteria pass.
4. Art/audio polish cannot block core systems before M3.
5. Rewrite only for failed criteria or data corruption risk.

## Definition of done per milestone
- Features implemented.
- Manual test script passes.
- Data schema validation passes.
- Save/load compatibility intact.
