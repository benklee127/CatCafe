# KayKit Core Subset

This directory is reserved for the vendored KayKit subset used by the hybrid 3D runtime.

Current state:
- Core gameplay is wired to 3D wrapper scenes in `Scenes/Prototype3D/Decor/`.
- Replace wrapper meshes with imported KayKit meshes as files become available.

Expected source mappings:
- `velvet_armchair`
- `espresso_bar`
- `wall_shelf`
- `window_perch`
